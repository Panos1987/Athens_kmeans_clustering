Description of the problem

In this project, we classify the neighborhoods in the city center of Athens by the method of k-means clustering 
depending on the number of parking stations as a criterion. The motivation to select this subject comes from the 
increasing demand for limited parking space in an urban area in which about 700k people reside and about 1.5m people 
work. Thus, we realize the high daily transport activity in the city center of Athens and its effects on the greater 
economy and the quality of daily life.

The aim of the project is to provide information through its results which can be useful in strategy planning and 
decision making for the Greek Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the authorities of the Municipality of 
Athens, and other entities and organizations which participate in the design of traffic networks and the management 
of relevant services.
