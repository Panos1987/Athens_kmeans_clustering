Description of data

The data that we used for our analysis consist of the following:
- number of neighborhoods in the city center of Athens, which are obtained from Foursquare API (Foursquare). The 
  sample includes 22 neighborhoods.
- number of parking stations in the city center of Athens, which are obtained from Foursquare API (Foursquare).

We are going to make a k-means cluster analysis in order to classify neighborhoods in the city center of Athens 
based on the categories of parking stations in the same geographical area. All data process and statistical analysis 
for the purposes of the project are going to be performed on a 64-bit Jupyter notebook by using Python 3.6 
programming language. Every stage of our analysis is going to be described in detail in the next section in Part 2.
