Description of data

The data that we are going to use for our analysis are for the following indicators:
- resident population per municipality of the metropolitan area of the city of Athens. The relevant data have been 
  obtained from the “City Population” website (City Population). The sample size includes 40 municipalities. The 
  original source of population number is the Population Census in 2011.
- number of ATMs per municipality, which are going to be obtained from Foursquare API (Foursquare).

In the next section with regard to the methodology that we are going to use, first we are going to present 
descriptive statistics of the above datasets in order to have a general view about the allocation of population 
and the number of ATMs among municipalities in the greater city of Athens, and second we are going to make a 
k-means cluster analysis in order to classify municipalities in the greater city of Athens based on the ratio given 
by the number of ATMs in each municipality over the population in each municipality. All data process and 
statistical analysis for the purposes of the project are going to be performed on notebook in IBM’s Watson platform 
by using Python programming language and the code will be available on Github repository. Every stage of 
our analysis will be described in detail in the next section.
